# Incident Response

## Severity levels

- MVP is a local CLI; incidents are limited to local execution failures.

## Response workflow

- Identify failure (provider outage, invalid config, missing runs).
- Re-run with corrected config or after provider recovery.

## Post-incident review

- Record root cause in the project changelog or issue tracker.

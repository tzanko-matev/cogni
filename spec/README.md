# Project Documentation (Spec)

This folder contains the technical documentation for the project. Each document is a
fill-in template. Replace placeholders with real project details as they become known.

## How to use this folder

- Start with `overview/project-summary.md` to set scope and goals.
- Capture requirements next (functional and non-functional).
- Use architecture and design docs to record the system shape and interfaces.
- Keep engineering and operations docs up to date as implementation evolves.
- Record major decisions in `architecture/decisions/`.

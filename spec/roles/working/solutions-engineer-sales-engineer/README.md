# Role: Solutions engineer or sales engineer

## Point of view
I run demos, proofs of concept, and integrations for prospects. I need a reliable path to "first run" and a clear story around results.

## I care about
- A fast, repeatable demo setup.
- Config samples that show best practices.
- Clear interpretation of results.

## I need from the spec
- A short evaluation guide and sample `.cogni.yml`.
- CLI workflow and expected artifacts.
- Limitations and guardrails.

## Success signals
- Demos run smoothly in under 30 minutes.
- Prospects understand the value immediately.
- POCs convert into real adoption.

# Role: AI agent working on the codebase

## Point of view
I execute tasks against the repository and must follow constraints, verify outputs, and cite evidence. I need unambiguous instructions and clear guardrails to avoid incorrect or unsafe changes.

## I care about
- Precise task definitions and success criteria.
- Tooling limits, budgets, and allowed actions.
- Where to read and how to interpret sources.

## I need from the spec
- Clear boundaries for read-only vs write actions.
- Definitions for outputs and required citations.
- Known edge cases and error handling expectations.

## Success signals
- Tasks complete with correct citations and outputs.
- Actions are safe and auditable.
- Results are consistent across runs.

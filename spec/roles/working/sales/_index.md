- Clear packaging and pricing assumptions.
- Common objections and responses.

## I need from the spec
- Product summary and success metrics.
- Examples of reports and results.
- Roadmap and known limitations.

## Success signals
- Prospects understand the value quickly.
- Sales cycles shorten with clear demos.
- Feedback feeds product priorities.

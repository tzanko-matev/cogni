# Product positioning

## Core value
Cogni provides a repeatable maintainability benchmark by asking questions about key product features and measuring the effort to answer them.

## Differentiation
- Repo-specific question suites with citations.
- Trend reporting over commits, not one-off snapshots.
- Read-only CLI that fits existing CI workflows.

## Scope boundaries
- No code changes, sandboxed runners, or hosted dashboards in MVP.
- Git-only and OpenRouter-only in MVP.

## Primary flows

- As a repo owner, I want to define a question suite in `.cogni/config.yml` under `.cogni/`, so that I can benchmark maintainability.
- As a repo owner, I want to evaluate Cucumber features with tests or expectations, so that I can measure implementation coverage without changing my tooling.
- As an engineer, I want to run a subset of tasks, so that I can check specific areas quickly.
- As a tech lead, I want to compare a commit against main, so that I can spot regressions.
- As a product manager, I want a report with trends, so that I can understand technical debt over time.
- As a CI system, I want to run the benchmark on push, so that results are tracked automatically.

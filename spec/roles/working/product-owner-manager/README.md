# Role: Product owner or manager (builder)

## Point of view
I define the product scope and prioritize work. I need a clear understanding of user needs and constraints.

## I care about
- Stakeholder alignment and clear outcomes.
- A roadmap tied to measurable impact.
- Non-goals that protect scope.

## I need from the spec
- Goals, non-goals, and success metrics.
- Stakeholder list and ownership.
- Risks and open questions.

## Success signals
- The team ships the MVP on time.
- Stakeholder expectations are met.
- Decisions are recorded and justified.

# Role: Legal and procurement

## Point of view
I evaluate licensing, terms, and procurement risk. I need a clear statement of dependencies and usage terms.

## I care about
- License compatibility and obligations.
- Third-party dependencies and providers.
- Support and maintenance expectations.

## I need from the spec
- License and dependency lists.
- Scope and usage limitations.
- Any required agreements or policies.

## Success signals
- Approvals are straightforward.
- Risks are identified early.
- Terms align with standard procurement.

# Role: Agent and LLM integration engineer

## Point of view
I own provider integration, agent behavior, and evaluation rules. I need clear expectations for prompts, tools, and metrics.

## I care about
- Provider configuration and retries.
- Tool call behavior and limits.
- Evaluation rules and citation validation.

## I need from the spec
- Built-in agent behavior and inputs.
- Metrics captured per attempt.
- Failure states and budget handling.

## Success signals
- Agent runs are stable and auditable.
- Evaluation results are consistent.
- Provider issues are handled cleanly.

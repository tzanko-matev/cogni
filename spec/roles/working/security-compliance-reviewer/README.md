# Role: Security and compliance reviewer

## Point of view
I review data handling, secrets, and risk. I need clear boundaries and safeguards for how the tool reads code and uses providers.

## I care about
- Data exposure and retention.
- Secrets management and key rotation.
- Provider risk and auditability.

## I need from the spec
- Data flow and security architecture.
- Environment variable requirements.
- Incident response guidance.

## Success signals
- Risks are documented and mitigated.
- No surprises in data handling.
- Clear guidance for safe operation.

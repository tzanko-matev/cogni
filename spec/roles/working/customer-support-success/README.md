# Role: Customer support or success

## Point of view
I help users onboard, troubleshoot, and succeed with Cogni. I need known issues, clear error messages, and playbooks.

## I care about
- Common failures and remedies.
- Steps to reproduce and debug issues.
- Clear guidance for first-time users.

## I need from the spec
- Troubleshooting and runbooks.
- Setup and configuration steps.
- Expected outputs and where to find them.

## Success signals
- Issues resolve quickly without escalation.
- Users reach first value smoothly.
- Support load declines over time.

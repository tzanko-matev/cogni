# Role: QA or test engineer

## Point of view
I validate that Cogni works end to end and that regressions are caught early. I need repeatable tests and fixtures.

## I care about
- E2E test coverage for core flows.
- Deterministic fixtures and outputs.
- Clear pass or fail criteria.

## I need from the spec
- Integration test plans and recipes.
- Acceptance criteria and edge cases.
- Expected artifacts and formats.

## Success signals
- Test runs are reliable and affordable.
- Failures pinpoint the cause.
- Coverage matches the real user flow.

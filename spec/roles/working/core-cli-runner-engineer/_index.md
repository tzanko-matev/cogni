# Role: Core CLI and runner engineer

## Point of view
I build the CLI commands, config handling, and execution pipeline. I need precise requirements and clear interfaces between components.

## I care about
- Command behavior and flags.
- Config validation and error paths.
- Output formats and compatibility.

## I need from the spec
- Functional requirements and acceptance criteria.
- Repository structure and module boundaries.
- Edge cases and failure modes.

## Success signals
- Commands are predictable and well tested.
- Outputs match the spec across runs.
- Changes are easy to reason about.

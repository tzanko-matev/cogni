# Role: Product manager or product owner (user)

## Point of view
I use Cogni reports to understand technical debt and how it impacts roadmap commitments. I need clear, non-technical summaries.

## I care about
- Trend lines that are easy to interpret.
- Plain-language explanations of regressions.
- Evidence to support roadmap tradeoffs.

## I need from the spec
- What the reports show and how to read them.
- Definitions for metrics and pass or fail states.
- How often benchmarks should run.

## Success signals
- Reports answer "did maintainability improve?"
- I can explain results to stakeholders.
- Metrics correlate with delivery pain.

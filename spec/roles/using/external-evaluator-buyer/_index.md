# Role: External evaluator or buyer

## Point of view
I am evaluating whether Cogni is worth adopting. I want a clear setup path, strong evidence, and a realistic view of costs and limits.

## I care about
- Time to first value and setup effort.
- Security and data handling expectations.
- What the product does and does not do.

## I need from the spec
- A short evaluation guide and example outputs.
- Configuration requirements and dependencies.
- Success criteria and known limitations.

## Success signals
- I can run a sample benchmark quickly.
- Results are credible and easy to share.
- The value outweighs the operational cost.

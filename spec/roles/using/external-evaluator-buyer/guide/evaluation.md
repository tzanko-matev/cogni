# Evaluation guide

## What you should verify
- Time to first benchmark is under 15 minutes.
- Results are understandable and backed by citations.
- Outputs are local and easy to share (`report.html`).

## Quick steps
- Run `cogni init` and add a small task.
- Run `cogni validate` and `cogni run`.
- Generate a report with `cogni report --range main..HEAD`.

## Constraints to note
- MVP is local-only, read-only, and git-only.

# Role: Individual engineer or tech lead

## Point of view
I use Cogni to spot regressions in understanding and to answer focused questions about the codebase. I want fast, targeted runs with reliable citations.

## I care about
- Running a subset of tasks quickly.
- Clear errors when configs or tasks are invalid.
- Evidence I can trust in code reviews and retros.

## I need from the spec
- Task selection syntax and agent overrides.
- Citation rules and evaluation behavior.
- Where to find per-task logs and results.

## Success signals
- I can validate a specific change in minutes.
- Failures include clear reasons and files.
- Reports help me prioritize fixes.

# Community usage

## Goal
Keep benchmarks lightweight and contributor-friendly.

## Recommended flow
- Provide a minimal `.cogni/config.yml` (in a `.cogni/` folder) with a small question set.
- Run locally before CI to reduce cost.
- Share `report.html` in issues or release notes.
- Keep results in `.cogni/results` (default) and ignore them in git.

## Guardrails
- Cogni is read-only and should not modify contributor repos.
- Keep tasks scoped to verifiable answers with citations.

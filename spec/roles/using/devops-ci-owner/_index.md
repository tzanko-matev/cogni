# Role: DevOps or CI owner

## Point of view
I integrate Cogni into CI and ensure runs are reliable, secure, and affordable. I want predictable behavior and clean artifacts.

## I care about
- Deterministic config and environment variables.
- Artifact paths and retention rules.
- Runtime, cost caps, and failure modes.

## I need from the spec
- CI/CD setup steps and example pipelines.
- Required secrets and how to rotate them.
- Exit codes and failure behavior.

## Success signals
- Runs are stable and do not flake.
- Artifacts are easy to collect and publish.
- Failures are actionable for engineers.

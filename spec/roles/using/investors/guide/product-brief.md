# Product brief

## Problem
Teams lack a repeatable, objective way to quantify how understandable a codebase is over time.

## Solution
Cogni runs a repo-specific question suite, measures correctness and effort, and trends results over commits.

## Current scope
- Local CLI with `init`, `validate`, `run`, `compare`, and `report`.
- Read-only execution and local outputs.

## Roadmap signals
- Multi-provider support and external agent adapters post-MVP.
- Improved report UX and CI smoke testing.

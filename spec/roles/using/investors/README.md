# Role: Current or potential investor

## Point of view
I use Cogni outputs and positioning to judge product traction and differentiation. I need a clear narrative backed by measurable outcomes.

## I care about
- Evidence of product value and adoption.
- Clear differentiation versus alternatives.
- A credible roadmap and execution risks.

## I need from the spec
- A concise product summary and scope.
- Examples of reports and outcomes.
- Known constraints and future direction.

## Success signals
- Outcomes map to business value.
- The product story is consistent and defensible.
- The roadmap addresses obvious gaps.

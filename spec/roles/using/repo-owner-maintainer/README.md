# Role: Repo owner and maintainer

## Point of view
I own a repository and want a repeatable way to measure maintainability. I need a low-friction setup that produces credible results I can share with my team.

## I care about
- Clear guidance for writing tasks and schemas.
- Stable outputs and trend comparisons.
- Control over runtime and cost.
- Minimal disruption to developer workflows.

## I need from the spec
- How to structure `.cogni.yml`, tasks, and agents.
- How outputs are stored and compared across commits.
- What counts as pass or fail for a task.

## Success signals
- A new suite runs in under 15 minutes.
- Results are understandable and actionable.
- Trends align with my intuition about the repo.

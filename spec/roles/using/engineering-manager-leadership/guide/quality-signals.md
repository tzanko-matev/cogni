# Quality signals

## What matters
- Consistent pass rates over time.
- Trend changes in tokens and wall time.
- Regressions highlighted by `compare` and `report`.

## Decision support
- Use trends to prioritize refactors and staffing.
- Treat spikes as indicators, not absolute truth.

## Scope reminders
- Cogni is read-only and does not change code.
- It is not a linter or SAST product.

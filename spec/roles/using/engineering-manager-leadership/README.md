# Role: Engineering manager or leadership

## Point of view
I use Cogni to monitor maintainability at a team or org level. I care about consistency, comparability, and avoiding false alarms.

## I care about
- Stable metrics across releases.
- Cross-repo comparability (when relevant).
- Actionable signal, not noise.

## I need from the spec
- Definitions for metrics and confidence limits.
- Guidance on interpreting trends and deltas.
- Limitations and non-goals to set expectations.

## Success signals
- Trends map to real engineering pain.
- Teams can act on clear recommendations.
- Exec updates are backed by evidence.

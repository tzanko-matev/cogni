# Inbox

This folder holds unprocessed notes and artifacts captured from outside sources
(e.g., interviews, external docs, research). Use it as a staging area before
integrating the information into the main spec documents.

## How to use

- Drop raw notes, links, or files here.
- Periodically triage items and move them into the appropriate spec sections.
- Remove or archive entries once integrated.
